Cloudflare Offers three different block page options:
1. Default - A Cloudflare branded block page will be shown to users
2. Custom Redirect URL - Any blocked request will be redirected to a URL specified by an administrator. Refer to this guide[https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-identity-dynamic] for an example of a dynamic custom block page.
3. Custom Page Template - Administrators can configure a custom HTML page hosted by Cloudflare that will be shown to users when blocked.

import { Render } from "~/components"

<Render file="access/block-page" />
